### RL-GO
This directory is created for a minor called 'Reinforcement Learning' in 2021 fall to store some notes, assignment code and ideas when learning this new field of ML for me.

The reference book is 'Reinforcement Learning' (An Introduction Second Edition) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. 

`RL-note.md` is the summurized version note derived from both the lecturer's material and the reference book for the exam,
and there is not much practice involved when learning this discipline.

Therefore, during the winter vacation, I am going to go over all the chapters I have read more carefully and to finish some exercise provided by the author accompnied by the 
posted [answers](https://github.com/LyWangPX/Reinforcement-Learning-2nd-Edition-by-Sutton-Exercise-Solutions).
